# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

- Use numpy and pandas dataframe to find Correlation Matrix, to understand how different features are correlated
- Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data
- Use scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets
- Train the data using Random Forest Classifier to predict the fraudulent transactions
- Gain 99.96% accuracy (less reliable for imbalanced datasets like fraud detection)
- Gain 97.47% precision (very few false positives)
- The model catches 78.57% of real frauds measured by recall_score
- The model shows 87.01% balance between precision and recall.
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 87.01% shows the model is making balanced predictions.
